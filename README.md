# Job_Bulletins_Analysis
<h1>Structuring and Analysing Job
descriptions using Natural Language Processing.</h1>

<p>The content, tone, and format of job bulletins can influence the quality of the applicant pool. Overly specific job requirements may discourage diversity. This project helps in restructuring and analysing the city of Los Angelesâ€™ job bulletins by using Machine Learning and Text Analytics. We are provided with a folder of 600+ plain text job postings held in the city of Lost Angeles in 2020. In this project I performed the following tasks:
<ul>1) to convert this folder full of text files into a proper single structured CSV file.</ul>
<ul>2)Use the data created to identify language or phrases that may inadvertently create gender and ethnicity bias.</ul> 
<ul>3)Use Exploratory Data Analysis to provide suggestions to improve the diversity and quality of the applicant pool </ul>
